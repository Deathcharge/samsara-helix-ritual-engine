# 🌀 Samsara Helix Ritual Engine (Z-88)

**Status:** **ARCHIVE CANDIDATE** - Logic being consolidated into `Deathcharge/helix-unified`.

This repository contains the original Z-88 Ritual Engine logic, which cycles in 108 steps, exporting visual and audio artifacts (GIF, MP4, WAV, PDF).

## 🚀 **v16.9 Overhaul Pulse Alignment**

This project's core logic has been integrated into the `helix-unified` repository to align with the **Helix Hub v16.8/v16.9** single source of truth architecture.

- **Function:** This engine is responsible for generating the Samsara fractals and audio artifacts that feed the **Samsara Visualizer** (Void Echo) and the **Ritual Impact Simulator** (Zapier).
- **Ethical Base:** Tony Accords (Nonmaleficence, Autonomy, Compassion, Humility).

## 🛠️ **Technical Specifications**

- **Base:** Streamlit Application
- **Dependencies:** Python 3.11, Streamlit, Librosa, Scipy (modernized in recent commit).
- **Consolidation Note:** All future development and maintenance will occur in `helix-unified`.
